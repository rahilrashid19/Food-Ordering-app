1. Never Create a new component inside another component... because when the rendering happens the nested component will be rendered everytime..

2. Never use useState hook inside an if statement or for loop because it will cause inconstency..

3. useState is a hook which react gives us to create a local state variable , so never use this hook outside the functional component..

****FOR ROUTING****

1. import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom..

2. create router from createBrowserRouter . it will be an array of objects in which each object will be a path.. eg below

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path:'/route',
        element: 'component to load'
    }
])

after creating the configuartion , we need to provide it to the app , 
render function will alawys render whatever we pass in to it..

so import routerProvider from the react-rouer-dom , and pass it to the root.render() with the router as appRouter.. eg below;

root.render(<routerProvider router={appRouter}/>)
